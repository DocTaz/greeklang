# Word tokens



## Tokenization

A string of Attic Greek can be split into *lexical tokens* on the [specified tokenizing characters](AtticString.html).

A lexical token can be converted to a (possibly empty) *word token* by removing all specified puncutation characters.

## Syllabification

Word tokens can be split into ordered sets of syllables where each syllable is a valid, non-empty Greek string.

## Accentuation

Accent characters can be automatically added to word tokens in cases where a recessive or persistent accent patterns persistent accent pattern does not require further morphological information, and vowel quantity is explicitly indicated.
