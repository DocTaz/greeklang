# Digital representation of Greek text

The linked specifications define a system for representing meaningful tokens in the standard alphabetic writing system used in manuscripts and printed editions of ancient Greek texts. It does not address the problem of representing epichoric Greek alphabets, which are unknown to Unicode.

The current draft aims to specify three kinds of token:  alphabetic text, numbers written in the "Milesian" notational system, and astronomical symbols.



## Specifications for alphabetic text


- Valid <a concordion:run="concordion" href="GreekString.html">strings of characters</a>
- Valid <a concordion:run="concordion"  href="GreekWord.html">lexical tokens</a> ("words")
- <a concordion:run="concordion"  href="GreekStringManip.html">Classifying characters</a> in Greek strings and tokens
- <a concordion:run="concordion"  href="GreekSort.html">Alphabetic sorting and comparison</a>


## Specifications for the "Milesian" numeric notation ##

The "Milesian" system of numeric notation borrowed glyphs from the alphabetic writing systems.  In addition glyphs from familiar from the standard literary Greek alphabet, these included glyphs for 6, 90 and 900 drawn from epichoric alphabets, and lacking any corresponding character in the later literary Greek alphabet.
