# Digital representation of Greek text

No section of the Unicode definition more thoroughly confuses the concepts of character in a writing system, glyph representing that character, and presentional variants of a glyph than the section dealing with polytonic Greek.  Before we can process or analyze digital texts in ancient Greek, therefore, we have to specify unambiguously how the writing system of literary Greek  is to be represented digitally.  (This does not address the problem of representing epichoric Greek alphabets, which are unknown to Unicode.)



## Specifications for alphabetic text


- Valid <a concordion:run="concordion" href="GreekString.html">strings of characters</a>
- Valid <a concordion:run="concordion"  href="GreekWord.html">lexical tokens</a> ("words")
- <a concordion:run="concordion"  href="GreekStringManip.html">Classifying characters</a> in Greek strings and tokens
- <a concordion:run="concordion"  href="GreekSort.html">Alphabetic sorting and comparison</a>


## Specifications for the "Milesian" numeric notation ##

The "Milesian" system of numeric notation borrowed glyphs from the alphabetic writing systems, including glyphs for 6, 90 and 900 drawn from epichoric alphabets, and lacking any corresponding character in the later literary Greek alphabet.



- Valid <a concordion:run="concordion" href="MilesianInteger.html">integers</a>
- Valid <a concordion:run="concordion" href="MilesianFraction.html">fractions</a>
- Valid <a concordion:run="concordion" href="MilesianString.html">strings of characters</a>
