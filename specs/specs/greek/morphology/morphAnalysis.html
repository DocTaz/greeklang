<h1>Morphological analyses</h1>

<p>Every morphological analysis identifies a part of speech.
Depending on the part of speech, the analysis identifies further properties.
</p>

<p>For conjugated verbs:  person, number, tense, mood and voice.
</p>

<p>For all substantives: gender, case and number.  For adjectives,
further identifies degree.</p>

<p>For participial forms of verbs, the "mood" is (untraditionally)
considered "participle", and the analysis further identifies
tense, voice, gender, case and number.
