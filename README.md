#greeklang#

Specification of a computational system for working with ancient Greek,
and implementations of the specification in code libraries.

The source for the specification is the `specs` directory, and uses 
[concordion](http://concordion.org/) to bind the specification to excecutable tests.

A version of the specification rendered with live test results is posted
[here](http://shot.holycross.edu/~nsmith/greekspec/Greek.html)

See [the project wiki](https://github.com/neelsmith/greeklang/wiki) for notes on aspects of this project.
