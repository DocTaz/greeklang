# Adding your own tests

- if you want to include added inflectional rules in your test, be sure you have added them to `fst/rules`
- in `fst/testdata/stems`, add lexicon file with vocabulary entries you want to test
- in `fst/testdata/wordlists`, add lists of Greek words in UTF-8 to analyze
- (run a gradle test)
