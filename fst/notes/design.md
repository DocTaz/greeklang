# Design notes

## definitions and requirements


- goal is a two-way mapping between a surface form and a morphological analysis
    - explicitly *not* attempting to create a system modelling either synchronic or diachronic linguistic features:  the internal system is a purely utilitarian black box supporting the goal of 2-way mapping
    - NB:  this is in general a good match to FST technology, but movable Greek accents are awkward
- rigorously specified formats for both surface forms and analyses
- clean separation of concerns:  system is *only* a morphological system
- all citable conceptual entities identified by URN
    - this enables integration in larger systems
- must support dynamically loaded lexica of stems and inflectional rules
- must support dynamically defined tagging of arbitrary (even non-morphological) taxonomies

## extratags

Data:

- 2 directories of dynamically loaded files:  one defining stems, and one implementing inflectional rules.  The directories should be configurable
- single list of additional tags

Process:

- automatically extract list of URNs from stems
- every lexicon should be identified by some user-defined stem, e.g., &lt;ml> for middle Liddell.  Enforce this by requiring *some* extratag to be included in lex stem
- *best practice recommendation*:  any additional inflectional patterns should also be tagged.  Not explicitly enforced, however.
- Need to map morpheus stem classes/tenses (inflectionl patterns) to Smyth references
- acceptors allow optional inclusion of additional tags



## verb pipeline


### princ.parts

- first step in verb pipeline
- filter on #classtem# tag:  group into $regular$ $irregular$ princ part groups, with separate transducers for each of regular formation patterns:
    - w_regular
    - [aeo]_contract
    - (other classes to be investigated regular -mi verbs, [aio]zw)
- other classtems must give all principal parts, normally 6, or possibly 4 for deponents.  Note that deponency is not a morphological feature: absence of principal parts is just a question of usage/attestation that might reflect in some cases the semantic and syntactic phenomenon of deponency.  A single transducer should simply classify 1st-6thpp stems and use thoses values.


### augment

- follows princ. parts in verb pipeline
- mark location in lexicon, eg. <aug>lu<verb>
- classify tense/mood combos as "augmented" "unaugmented"
- define transforamtion of <aug> -> e with appropriate neighboring modifications:
    - add breathing if initial
    - drop preceding vowel
    - compound!

## accent

Data:

- explicitly characterize nominal stems with one of 3 tags `<ultacc><penacc><antacc>`
- quarrying from morpheus: it looks like default nominal entries are &lt;antacc> ("as good as recessive"), with morpheus labels `stem_acc` and `suff_acc` identifying `<penacc>` and `<ult_acc>` respectively

Process:

- gradle build takes list of words (configurable: default `wordlist.txt`), cps to buidl area
- strip accent, write list of stripped words to build area
- run FST on stripped list
- parse FST output:
    - record FST failures
    - from analysis, add accent to stripped form, cf to source string

## lexicon

- map lexicon entries to URN values in .csv file in extracting entries from morpheus source
- use .csv white boards to check off progress
- use HMT project vocab lists to drive development of inflectional patterns for real corpora:
   - *Iliad*
   - scholia
   - other texts


## unifying and integrating data

- URNs for lexical entities drawn from external lex.ent. source
- generate URNs for stems, with one collection per "lexicon".  Since each lexicon has a lex.ent. URN, we have mapped stems to lexical entities.
- generate URNs for inflectional patterns:  at what level is collection and object?  Might be sensible to include URN per transducer and output that along with stem class.  Or is stem class enough?
- do we need URNs for each fundamental analysis pattern (without tags)? e.g., each PNTMV combo for conjugated verbs?
- could we put smyth references on transducers as optional tags?
- consider library support for RDF output


## development sequence

- harness for groovy unit tests.  Or use shell script-based tests?
- complete conjugated forms of Smyth #308
- infinitives. Will need classification of nominal accent.
- âˆš verbal adjs (sep PoS b/c no degree!)
- ptcpls
- adjs: regular formation of comp, superl
