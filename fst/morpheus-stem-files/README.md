The files in these subdircectories are selected files taken directly from the `morpheus/stemlib/Greek/stemsrc/` directory of the morpheus source code.  I have omitted scripts ad other non-data files found there.  Otherwise, the only change I have made is to group the files in three subdirectories:

-	`lexstems` includes 55 files that have morpheus lexical stem entries
- `compounding` has 2 files with information about formation of compound verbs
-	`pns-paus` has 4 files with information about proper names in Pausanias
