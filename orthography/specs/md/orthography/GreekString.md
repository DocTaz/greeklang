# GreekStrings

GreekStrings are composed exclusively of characters in the small set relevant for ancient Greek: Greek alphabetic characters, accents, breathings, punctuation marks or white space.
	
GreekStrings are created from Strings by mapping Unicode code points on to the ancient Greek characters according to one of two mappings:

- an <a concordion:run="concordion" href="AsciiXlit.html">ASCII-only transcription</a> based on the TLG project's Beta Code
- a subset of the <a concordion:run="concordion" href="UcodeXlit.html">ancient Greek range</a> of Unicode

When GreekStrings are converted back to Strings, they use the the ASCII convention, with all alphabetic characters represented by lower-case Roman characters. An asterisk identifies an upper-case character in the GreekString.
