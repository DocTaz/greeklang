# Sample data sets

Each subdirectory contains a complete data set for building a parser. You can build a parser from any of the data sets by setting the `datadir` property to the name of this directory, and the `dataset` property to the name of one of the subdirectories.  The morphology project's `scripts` directory has shell scripts that offer a simplified way to call the appropriate gradle tasks while setting the property values on the command line.

The data sets planned for inclusion here in the 1.0 release of Kan≈çnes are:

| Data set | Orthography                      | Description                                                                                                         |
