Files in this directory ending in `.fst` will be compiled as lexica of stems for the morphological parser.

To build a corpus-specific parser, you must either include at least one `.fst` in this directory, or include one or more source files in the `stems-lexica` directory system, and `.fst` files will be automatically added to this directory from those source files.

See the documentation for details on the format of stem lexica.
