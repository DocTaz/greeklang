title: Designing a morphological parser for ancient Greek
layout: page
---

Must take account of:

- historical language
- closed production (follows from historical language, but could apply to modern languages)

Emphatically *not* a system taking input of string data and outputting (structured) string data.

Also *not* a parser for notional "Greek".

Citable output includes:

- morphological form
- lexical entity
- internal components applied to arrive at analysis:
    - stem
    - inflectional pattern
