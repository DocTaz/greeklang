notes to add to proper place in docs....



Irregular and indeclinable forms are record *with* accent.  By definition, these cannot be added algorithmically.

*Irregular* forms record the accented form in the inflectional pattern.

*Indeclinable tokens* recrod the nomarlized accented form in the stem pattern.
